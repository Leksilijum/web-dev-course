To quickly get started with a project template, we recommend using the [Quasar CLI](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/).

In these instructions, we assume you already have Yarn installed. First, install the Quasar CLI:
```yarn global add @quasar/cli```

Then, create a project from your terminal:
```quasar create hello-world```

This will create a new folder on your device. Open the folder in VS Code and browse through it to see how a Quasar project is usually organised.
