In this folder, you will find the group work done after the [week 1](https://www.activisthandbook.org/en/academy/web-dev/week-1) session.

## JavaScript
JavaScript is the standard language used for client-side scripting, meaning that it is supported by modern major web browsers 
and enables creating interactive user experiences on the web. Developed in 1995 by Brandon Eich, originally with the name of LiveScript,
it is a scripting language which has a weak type system, follows many concepts of functional programming and allows for the prototype-
based Object-Oriented Programming. It is often used to manipulate the DOM with many client-side frameworks having been developed and 
adopted in recent years.
## HTML
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. HTML consists of elements which have 4 main parts: <ol>
  <li>The opening tag</li>
  <li>The closing tag</li>
  <li>The content</li>
  <li>The element</li>
</ol>

Elements can also have attributes. Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. An attribute should always have: A space between it and the element name; attribute name followed by an equal sign, the attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.

This barely scratches the surface about HTML, I highly recommend you find sources online, I picked this information from  
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics">Mozilla Web Docs</a>
