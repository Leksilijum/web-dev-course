## JavaScript
JavaScript is the standard language used for client-side scripting, meaning that it is supported by modern major web browsers 
and enables creating interactive user experiences on the web. Developed in 1995 by Brandon Eich, originally with the name of LiveScript,
it is a scripting language which has a weak type system, follows many concepts of functional programming and allows for the prototype-
based Object-Oriented Programming. It is often used to manipulate the DOM with many client-side frameworks having been developed and 
adopted in recent years.
