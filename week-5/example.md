To quickly get started with a project template, we recommend using the [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org). There is even a graphical user interface!

In these instructions, we assume you already have Yarn installed. First, install the Vue CLI:
```yarn global add @vue/cli```

Next, start the GUI: 
```vue ui```

Or create a project from your terminal:
```vue create hello-world```

This will create a new folder on your device. Open the folder in VS Code and browse through it.
